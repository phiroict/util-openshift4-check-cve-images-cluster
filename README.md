# util-openshift4-check-cve-images-cluster
A check util in powershell 5+ to check the openshift cluster against the CVE database of Redhat

Will check the RH CVE database for openshift4 and then compares these against the installed images on the cluster. 

# Stack 

- OC commandline
- Openshift account that can read container configuration for all pods 
- Being logged on the the account by `oc login`
- Powershell 5+ installed (Tested under MacOS and Windows 10) should work under linux as well.

```powershell
pwsh openshiftcve-afflicted-scanner.ps1
```

Have fun!
